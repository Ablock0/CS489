    <p> Golfing is something I have always loved to go play just for fun, but this summer I became very passionate about it.
    I played every chance I got, and was still using my junior set of clubs from when I was a freshman in high school. So for
    christmas I actually got a new set of clubs that fit me and I am very excited to start using them once the Pullman and Colfax
    courses open back up in the spring time.</p>
