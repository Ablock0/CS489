    <p> One of the things I love to do in my free time is to fish. I usually go salmon fishing at least once a year,
    along with a few bass trips here and there. In the spring after school ends I was planning on going bow fishing on
    the snake river here in the palouse, I just need to wait until it gets a little warmer!</p>
